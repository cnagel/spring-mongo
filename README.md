spring-skeleton
===============

Spring-skeleton is a simple but solid bootstrap to work with the Java Spring framework. It's getting maintained by the core developer of [surpreso.com](http://www.surpreso.com) and introduces modern techniques to get the best from Spring.

A documentation for each development step is shown on the authors blog [Bits and Kites](http://bits-and-kites.blogspot.com/).

At this time, the skeleton
* loads the Spring context from configuration classes annotated by @Configuration
* loads properties from the application.properties file
